		<p>“Online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the Internet for teacher/student interaction and the distribution of class materials.” From this simple deﬁnition comes an almost inﬁnite number of ways to teach and learn outside of traditional classrooms and away from college campuses.</p>

		<p>For children going to school, online learning takes away the opportunity to build social skills and is not very effective in peer-group learning. ... Frequent testing is one of the best ways to learn at all ages. Being seen as the smartest baby is not a great way for the kid to learn (neither is it useful for an adult).</p>
		
		<p>Online learning can be as good or even better than in-person classroom learning. Research has shown that students in online learning performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction, but it has to be done right.</p>
